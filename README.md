# CV - Paul Garcia

Hi, I’m a full-stack web developer, currently working with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js).

My main focus right now is being as good as I can at writing organized, well-tested JavaScript. I have some API and RESTful web application projects in the works, and I'm learning behavioral driven development (BDD) with Mocha.

What’s next for me after I’ve mastered the MEAN stack? React, PostgreSQL, and PHP to name a few.

I’m also looking forward to improving my skills with Python and C, and learning more about encryption, security, and secure coding practices. I also dig Linux, BSD, Internet protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc.) and server and network administration.
